A food production factory has 5 type of products:
- Canned
- Home Hygienics
- Dairy
- Snacks
- Protein

Each production line works in a different builiding. The main warehouse is inside the factory and it has 5 storage rooms. However there's no refrigerator to keep the perishable goods and they have to send these prodects with cars that have refrigerators implemented in them.

Imperishable goods need a maximum storage day labeled on them.

Perishable goods need maximum and minimum temperature labeled on them.

The work flow goes like this:

The Marketing and Sales team with the Financial manager, start to brainstorm and plan on what goods to produce according to customer demands.

The technial supervisor of each line is responsible for producing the products that have been submitted in the system.

These products are transported to the warehouses and the warehouse supervisor has to 
record the products that have been received and stored in the warehouse.

Sales Team:

They find what goods are in demand according to customer demands, market analysis, etc. They predict the number and type of these products. This team should be able to record their orders. 

The order statuses are seperated in three groups by the technical supervisor:

- In queue = products that will be produced soon
- In production = products that are currently being produced 
- Done and delivered = products that have been produced and delivered to the warehouse
